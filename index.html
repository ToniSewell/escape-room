        <p>Agent, we have heard whispers of an evil plot from the data V.I.K.I.N.G.S over in Fjordhelm, and we need you to help us. Your objective is to get hold of their computer that holds their evil plan and destroy it. You need to participate in an adventure through the mountains and the seas, and prove your knowledge to the mischievous vikings in your way. Once you reach the viking base, you will need to sneakily search through their highly secured lair until you have sight of the computer. This is not just any escape; it's a test of your skills in observation, analysis, and problem-solving.
Your training as an Agent of Data has prepared you for this moment. Trust in your abilities, use every skill at your disposal, and make your escape from the evil V.I.K.I.N.G.S' lair a success. Good luck, Agent. The fate of the world rests in your hands.</p>
